            <h1>Software improvement tools</h1>
            
            <p>There are different types of software available for process 
            improvement. Software can be used to improve design process and 
            manufacturing process. The use of software can also save time and 
            resources. There are two main types of software which can be used 
            for process improvement â€“ statistical/numerical analysis software 
            and graphical software. </p>
            
            <hr />
            
            <h2>Statistical / Numerical Analysis software</h2>
            
            <p>Statistical or numerical analysis software can be used to 
            analyse the exist data to optimise the current process. Software 
            such as MATLAB and RS/1 are able to analyse the experimental data, 
            create plots based on the data and optimise the results. There are 
            many more software that can be used for process improvement, both 
            paid and free software. </p>
            
            <p>A list of numerical analysis software is available from
                <a href="resources/List%20of%20numerical%20analysis%20software.html">

            <h2>Graphical Software</h2>
            
            <p>Graphical software can be used to create the basic quality 
            control graphical tools. Spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft 
            Excel and OpenOffice Calc are capable of creating simple plots 
            including histograms, Pareto chart, scatter diagram and control 
            chart. But there are also professional software which are 
            specifically designed for TQM such as Pathmaker which can create 
            the quality control graphical tools.</p>
            
            <p>A list of graphical software is available from
