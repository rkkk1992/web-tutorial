            <h1>ISO 9000</h1>
            
            <p>The ISO 9000 family is a set of international standards for 
            quality management systems. It is used to demonstrate that there 
            is an effective quality management system in place, appropriate 
            when trying to formalise operations to ensure consistency of 
            approach. By establishing a consistent approach, it becomes easier 
            to ensure that tasks are carried out in the same way whoever does 
            them. This in turn ensures consistent quality for customers.</p>
            
            <p>There are 13 steps associated with building a quality management
            system (OMS).</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Obtain management understanding of, and commitment to, the 
                quality management approach.</li>
                <li>Define the scope of the activities to be included in the 
                OMS.</li>
                <li>Define the organisational structure and responsibilities 
                of those within the scope of the OMS.</li>
                <li>Audit the existing systems and procedures against the 
                requirements of the standard.</li>
                <li>Develop a plan to write the necessary procedures.</li>
                <li>Train sufficient personnel to write their own procedures.
                </li>
                <li>Draft and edit the procedures and gain agreement to them.
                </li>
                <li>Compile a draft quality manual.</li>
                <li>Implement the system on a trial basis.</li>
                <li>Train internal auditors to carry out audits of the system 
                and its operation.</li>
                <li>Revise the operation of the system in light of the results 
                of audits and other information.</li>
                <li>Apply for registration (sometimes called third-party 
                approval) from an accredited body.</li>
                <li>Maintain the system by internal audit, using it as an 
                opportunity to improve.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>A QMS normally contains four levels of documentation. These are:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>A quality policy manual: this is a policy document, a 
                statement of intent about what you intend to do.</li>
                <li>A quality procedures manual: this is a more detailed 
                series of documents detailing how you will carry out the 
                ‘whats’ of the quality policy manual.</li>
                <li>Quality records: these are the proofs that the ‘hows’
                have been carried out.</li>
                <li>Work instructions: these are the small details that explain
                how specific tasks are carried out. Each procedure may have 
                several work instructions for different products or services.
                </li>
            </ol>
